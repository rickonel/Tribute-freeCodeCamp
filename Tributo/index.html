                    <li><b>1939:</b> On 4 September, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS</li>
                    <li><b>1941:</b> By late, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated.</li>
                    <li><b>1942:</b> uring travelled to the United States in November and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington;<br/>he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.</li>
                    <li><b>1946:</b> He presented a paper on 19 February, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer. </li>
                    <li><b>1954:</b> On 8 June, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow,[153] Turing's housekeeper found him dead. <br/>He had died the previous day at the age of 41. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.</li>

            <p class="cite">A plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'. There is also a Bertrand Russell quotation: "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beautyâ€”a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture." The sculptor buried his own old Amstrad computer under the plinth as a tribute to "the godfather of all modern computers"</p>
